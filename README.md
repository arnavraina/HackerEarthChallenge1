Problem Statement
In this project, we aim to predict the financial returns of various portfolios based on historical trading data. The dataset comprises details of portfolio transactions, including trade and sale dates, amounts, and rates such as Euribor and Libor, which are pivotal in financial calculations. The train.csv file provides comprehensive training data with associated returns, while the test.csv file contains similar information without the returns, which we need to predict. The sample_submission.csv showcases the required format for these predictions.
